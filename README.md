Kerbal Space Program Real Career mod and career pack.  
This is a mod that replaces the stock contracts. 
The goal is to create contract packs that offer a more real career like experience.

### Required Mods

Without these mods it won't work:

- USI Sounding Rockets required for the first carreer stage (to be depreciated)
- ContractConfigurator required to create contracts
- RemoteTech for communication

### Highly Recommended Mods

These mods offer additional stories (contract set):

- MechJeb to make your life so much easier!
- ScanSat to scan for resources

### Recommended Mods

- Station & Base building mods
  - USI MKS
  - StationPartsExpansionRedux
- Life Support mods
  - USI life support
  - ?
- TweakScale will allow you to change size parts. The contracts are designed to do without this mod and this mod actually adds a tremendous amount of extra parts just for size. But you can make more beautiful stuff with the right sized parts.

### Unsupported Mods

At the moment none are known. Please report any problems with other mods.

## Known issues

- The 0.625m fairing trusses don't allign with the attached part.
- CP1.8.2 sometimes the timer of one of the satellites doesn't count down anymore. This seems to be an issue in how KSP visualizes the timer in the contract, it does count down. Change the focus to that satellite and wait for the other timers to finish. Suddenly also the other timer is finished and the contract completed.
