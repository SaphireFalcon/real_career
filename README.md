Kerbal Space Program Real Career mod and career pack.  
This is a mod that replaces the stock contracts. 
The goal is to create contract packs that offer a more real career like experience.

### Required Mods

Without these mods it won't work:

- USI Sounding Rockets required for the first carreer stage (to be depreciated)
- ContractConfigurator required to create contracts
- RemoteTech for communication

### Highly Recommended Mods

These mods offer additional stories (contract set):

- MechJeb to make your life so much easier!

### Recommended Mods

- Station & Base building mods
  - USI MKS
  - StationPartsExpansionRedux
- Life Support mods
  - USI life support
  - ?
- TweakScale will allow you to change size parts. The contracts are designed to do without this mod and this mod actually adds a tremendous amount of extra parts just for size. But you can make more beautiful stuff with the right sized parts.
- ScanSat to scan for resources

### Unsupported Mods

At the moment none are known. Please report any problems with other mods.

## Starting the game

To start create a new game in career mode with the following settings in the tabs:

- Basic:
  - Turn off "Allow Reverting Flights" (Optional: Extra hard)
  - Turn off "Allow Quick loading" (Optional: Extra hard)
  - Turn off "missing crew respawns" (recommended)
  - Turn off "No entry purchase required on research" (Recommended)
  - Turn off "Enable comm Network" (Not sure if RT overrides this)
  - Starting funds: 0 (recommended, you get enough in the career missions)
  - Starting science: 0 (recommended, you get enough in the career missions)
  - Starting reputation: 0 (recommended, you get enough in the career missions)
  - rewards and penalties: 100% (recommended)
- Advanced:
  - Turn off "Kerbal Level Up Immediately" (There's a part for that)
  - Turn off "Allow Negative Funds/Science" (Else too easy)
  - Turn on "Part pressure limits" (recommended)
  - Turn on "Part G-force limits" (recommended)
  - Turn on "Kerbal G-force limimts" (recommended)
  - Turn on "Resource transfer obeys crossfeed rules" (recommended)
  - Turn on "Part Upgrades" (recommended)
  - Turn on "Require signal for Control" (REQUIRED)
  - Turn on "Plasma blackout" (extra hard)
  - Turn off "Enable extra ground stations" (REQUIRED)
- Contract Configurator:
  - Turn all stock contracts off
  - Turn all other contract groups off.
  
> Turning off reverting flights and allow quick loading makes it harder, but one can always use the normal save and loading options. It's more of a hassle.

### kOS configuration

When using kOS choose RemoteTech communication.

### ScanSat configuration

The default settings are mostly oke. They disable stock scanning and require the more advances ScanSat settings. Disabling "resource biome lock" will make it a bit more challenging as landing in the right spot is more important.  
It is possible to go completely without this mod, I just never tried that.

## Known issues

- The 0.625m fairing trusses don't allign with the attached part.
- CP1.8.2 sometimes the timer of one of the satellites doesn't count down anymore. This seems to be an issue in how KSP visualizes the timer in the contract, it does count down. Change the focus to that satellite and wait for the other timers to finish. Suddenly also the other timer is finished and the contract completed.
