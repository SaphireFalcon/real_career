  description = The previously launched weather satelite covers the whole planet once every 6 days. This is not sufficient. Therefore, KOAA is asking to launch 5 more of the same satelites, such that the whole planet is covered at least once a day. 
  
  // Optional
  notes = Launch 5 more satelites in similar orbits, but than their orbit shifted 60 degrees around the planet. By accelerating perpendicular to the flight direction at the poles, the shift can be changed. Also make sure that they pass the equator at the same time. Note: If it takes 7 days to do a full scan, you either need to change the orbit or launch one more satelite. Sidenote: please erase the scansat data for Kerbin, such that it can be regenerated by the current satelites (this can't be done by a contract). 
  // circular orbit with period of 42m45s has a spacing of 5 parts in between two passes -> leaves small gaps
  // circular orbit with period of 40m39s has a spacing of 6 parts in between two passes.
  // circular orbit with period of 43m20s has a spacing of 7 parts in between two passes.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Build a satelite and launch it into a polar orbit.
