  description = The previously launched weather satelite covers the whole planet once every 6 days. This is not sufficient. Therefore, KOAA is asking to launch 5 more of the same satelites, such that the whole planet is covered at least once a day. 
  
  // Optional
  notes = Launch 5 more satelites in the same orbits, but than their orbit shifted a few degrees around the planet, such that the satelites combined create a much wider FoV. Launch at the right moment and by accelerating perpendicular to the flight direction at the poles, the shift can be changed. Also make sure that they pass the equator at the same time. Sidenote: please erase the scansat data for Kerbin, such that it can be regenerated by the current satelites (this can't be done from a contract). You could first put the satelites in orbit and then accept the contract.
  // circular orbit with period of 40m39s has a spacing of 6 parts in between two passes.
  //    Increase the orbital period to 40m40s such that it will shift a little over time.
  //    It's extremely difficult to create 6 orbits without (small) gaps.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Build a satelite and launch it into a polar orbit.
