  description = The commercial department approached you with a request from a TV station. They want to reach a wider audience, but some of them live in a mountainous area, thus normal TV antenna's are not as effective. When they heard about your space agency, they approached us with their problem. Maybe you can find a solution to their problem.

  // Optional
  notes = Since the client only wants to target a small target area. The best solution would be to launch a satellite in Kerbin Stable Orbit (KSO). This is an orbit where the orbital period is equal to the sideral rotation period of Kerbin (The time it takes Kerbin to rotate once around its own axis). Note: To get the connection of a dish working, you need to target an object or vessel. Make sure the receivers target the satellite and the satellite targets one of them such they are all covered.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a satellite with a dish that can transmit the tv channels of the tv station.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, now all those bench watchers can continue enjoying their favourite TV shows.
