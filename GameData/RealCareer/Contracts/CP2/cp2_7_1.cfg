  description = Scanning the planet taught us a few things. Your engineers and scientist have been working together in creating new scientific experiments. Launch them and learn more about Kerbin. Also, your scientists expect to get more science in high altitude above Kerbin.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Build a probe and launch it into high altitude above Kerbin. Note: Look up what the altitude is for high altitude and perform all experiments there. Don't forget to do experiments in low altitude with the new science experiments.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a probe into high altitude above Kerbin.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Much more science to unlock more parts.
