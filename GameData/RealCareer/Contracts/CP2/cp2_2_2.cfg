  description = On Kerbin various institutions want to obtain global communication. So far we have achieved coverage of a larger area around the equator. But the polar research bases don't have coverage. The sales department thinks you can create a network of communication satelites that achieves this.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Build and launch new satelites that will provide full communication coverage with at least a 750km range antenna. Note: switch to the north and south pole receivers to activate the counting. Side-note: If after accepting this contract there are some errors. Please report them, these are probably created because the spawned craft files can't be found.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Build a ComSat network covering Kerbin.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, now we'll have communication all over Kerbin.
