  description = A mining agency contacted the sales department with a request to launch a satelite to scan for recourses. Our engineers have been working on a scanner like that and were looking to test it. 
  
  // Optional
  notes = Build a satelite and launch it into a polar orbit. Choose the altitude (and inclination) of the orbit such that the scanner will cover the surface of Kerbin within the shortest amount of time. Also note that the scanner only functions on the sunny side of the planet. Note: One can visualize the satelites path with the scansat map. Here the orange line on the equator is in the middle of the FoV, the blue line to the left and right should be exactly on the edges of the FoV. In this way the next pass (orange line) is not overlapping the previous pass. This does assume that each (orange) pass is on the light side of the planet. The number of orange lines between the orange and blue dots (passes) is the number of days it takes to scan the whole planet, not taking overlap into account.
  // circular orbit with period of 42m45s has a spacing of 5 parts in between two passes -> leaves small gaps
  // circular orbit with period of 40m39s has a spacing of 6 parts in between two passes.
  // circular orbit with period of 43m20s has a spacing of 7 parts in between two passes.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
