  description = Your boss Kelon Tusk wants you to make a rocket that can orbit Kerbin. Luckily, you were allowed to open a new research department. You gave them their first assignment to find out what is needed to make a rocket orbit Kerbin. Today your scientists came to you. They told you that you need to be able to steer your rocket. The rocket first needs to go up. Then in space you need to rotate the rocket to make the rocket fly around the planet.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Your engineers heard this and made a movable fin that allows you to rotate your rocket. They think this should be sufficient to make your rocket rotate. Lets try it out by making a turn and fly to the waypoint. Note: When on the launchpad, go to map view ('M') and find the waypoint, click it and activate navigation. Now you'll see the waypoint on the navball in the bottom. 

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Fly the rocket to the set waypoint.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, maybe adding wings to the rocket was not such a bad idea of your boss, they just had to be movable!
