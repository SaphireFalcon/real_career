  description = Up to now the rockets we send into orbit had almost no inclination. However, your scientists Walter Kohmann and Jean Kelambre told you that you'll need to be able to adjust the inclination of your orbit to travel to Mun and some other planets. But also you'll need to create an inclined orbit, up to a fully inclined polar orbit, for specific types of satellites.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Change the inclination of your orbit. Note: In flight modus in the bottom left in manoeuvre mode and then the advanced orbital information tab, one can see the inclination. Alternatively, one could use a mod such as MechJeb. Changing the inclination of your orbit is best achieved at the point where it intersects with Kerbins equator. Unfortunately, the ascending/descending nodes are only shown when targeting another ship or body. Since the Mun has no inclination with respect to Kerbin, one could target the Mun to get this information.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Change the inclination of your orbit.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, we now can change the inclination of our orbit! Note: when accelerating into orbit, one can also aim such that one already gets the desired inclination. Moreover, starting from a different space center could help as well.
