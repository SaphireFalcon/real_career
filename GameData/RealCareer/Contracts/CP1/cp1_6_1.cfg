  description = Strangely your rocket didn't get as high with the gyro as without it, while having about the same delta-v. Also, before you noticed that when the engine is off the apoapsis of the flight is reducing (CP1.2.2). You asked your scientists about this, but they want you to do some experiments. First, they want to find out what the influence is of barometric pressure on the drag of the rocket.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Create a rocket with a barometer in a service bay. Note: don't forget to do the experiment in space and keep the data for science points.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a rocket to space with a barometer.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Your scientists have some data to crunch on.
