  description = Strangely your rocket didn't get as high with the gyro as without it, while having about the same delta-v. Also, you remembered that when the engine is off the apoapsis of the flight is declining (CP1.2.2). You asked your scientists about this, but they want you to do some experiments. First, they want to find out what the influence is of barometric pressure on the drag of the rocket.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Create a rocket with a barometer in a service bay. Note: Before launch one can open the service bay doors and select the part and pin the display. Then close the door again. You can display the measurement too if you want.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a rocket with a barometer.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Your scientists have some data to crunch on.
