  description = Your boss Kelon Tusk has seen you shoot a few rockets up in the sky. But every time they come down with a bang. He told you that you need to find a way to shoot rockets up that come down gently. How would otherwise those brave astronauts come back alive?
  
  // Optional
  notes = Make the rocket land safely by adding a parachute. Your engineers added a big tablecloth in the party hat controller. Note: In building mode (VAB), on the right there are stages, plan the parachute such that it opens in the last stage.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Make the rocket return intact.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, now we just have to refuel the rocket and we can go again! When did you open the parachute?
