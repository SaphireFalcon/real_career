  description = Making an exact circular orbit is quite difficult in one go. Therefore, you asked your scientist how to make this easier. Kohannes Kepler and Walter Kohmann came to see you a few days later. They told you that if you want to change the highest point (Apoapsis) of an orbit, one needs to accelerate or decelerate at the lowest point (Perapsis) and vise-versa.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Achieve a low Kerbin orbit (LKO), change the apoapsis to the desired altitude, and when reaching that altitude, circularize your orbit with only a small margin of error. Note: Unlocking Mission Control lvl 2 and Tracking Station lvl 2 will allow you to create manoeuvre nodes, which you can use to plan your orbits. Next to the nav ball it will show you how much delta-v is needed and burn time of current stage at maximum thrust to achieve the planned orbit. Use this tool wisely!

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Achieve a nice circular orbit around Kerbin.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, we now can change the altitude of our orbit! Note: You should have noticed that when trying to make your rocket orbit Kerbin the Apoapsis changes when accelerating to achieve that. Keep that in mind when one needs to create a higher orbit, such that you take two or more steps to reach it.
