  description = Your scientist found a few things out. First, drag is the resistance the rocket experiences. Second, this drag gets converted into heat and can cause (overheating) explosions! Therefore, the scientists sat down with your engineers and found out that the first gyro was not very aerodynamicaly shaped. Thus they made a better one!
  
  // Optional
  notes = Try again, but now with the new gyro. Note: Drag is an important factor of launching a rocket and is based on the speed, altitude (atmospheric density) and aerodynamic shape of the rocket. Having more drag will result in higher delta-v requirements to get the rocket to orbit.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = See how high 2000 delta-v gets you.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, we got the upper stage of our rocket.
