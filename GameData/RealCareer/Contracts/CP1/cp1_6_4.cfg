  description = After testing the measurement equipment your scientists had been visiting your office every day, to check how far along you are with sending the equipment into orbit. Luckily for them today you told them it was time to pack their equipment and mount it on a rocket.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Bring the measurement equipment into space. When in orbit, run the experiments and transmit back to your hungry scientists. Make sure that you bring enough batteries, transmitting data requires a lot of energy. Note: you'll notice that in orbit you'll be able to gather from the same equipment more science. Based on the situation (orbit, landed, in flight) and location (Kerbin, Mun, etc.) the base science is multiplied by a (signicant) factor. You should look it up on the KSP wiki.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a rocket into space with the measurement equipment.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Your scientists have some data to crunch on. Note: Only part of the total science could be transmitted, depending on the type of measurement equipment, the measurement can be repeated. Also, some measurements are biome bound. (look on the internet for more details)
