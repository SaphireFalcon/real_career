  description = Congratulations you managed to launch your first rocket. The next day two of your engineers came to you. They are having a heated discussion. Stagira Karchimeds says that if you limit the thrust of the rocket, it will consume less fuel and will be able to fly longer and thus higher. But Isaak Kewton says that you only get higher with more delta-v. To resolve this disagreement you have agreed to launch a rocket with the same amount of delta-v but less thrust. If the rocket achieves a higher altitude Stagira Karchimeds is right, if it achieves the same height, Isaak Kewton is right.
  
  // Optional
  notes = The Weight to Thrust ratio describes how much thrust the rocket has compared to the weight of the rocket. A ratio below 1.0 will generate less thrust than is needed to lift the rocket. The higher the ratio the faster the rocket will accelerate and the higher speed it will achieve.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Build a rocket with a maximum Weight to Thrust ratio of 1.2

  completedMessage = Congratulations! You proved that both engineers are wrong!
