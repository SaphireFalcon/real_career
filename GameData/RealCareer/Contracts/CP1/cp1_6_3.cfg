  description = Your scientists are extremely data hungry. So they asked the engineers to make some equipment to measure a lot of data.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Put the equipment on the launch pad and test the equipment, then recover the parts. Don't forget to bring batteries. Note: Don't forget to read the messages after completing the contract. This is valid for many other contracts as well!

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Test the measurement equipment at KSC.

  completedMessage = Om nom, that is yummy! Note: There are many different locations (biome) on Kerbin (and hidden around KSC) that offer science. Also, in flight there is science to be gathered. If you're in need of some extra science this could provide a small amount of cheap science.
