  description = Your scientist have crunched the numbers gathered by the measurement equipment. But now they need you to do real experiments in space to learn more. Ofcourse the results of these experiments cannot be transmitted and you'll have to safely recover the equipment from space.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Put the experimental equipment on a rocket and launch it into orbit. Perform the experiments and return the equipment safely to your scientist. Note: with the USI's Sounding Rockets mod (and some others) you'll be able to gather more science by adding more parts. But still one has to go many places to collect sufficient science to unlock the whole tech tree.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a rocket to space with the experimental equipment.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Your scientists have some data to crunch on.
