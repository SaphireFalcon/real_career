  description = The next experiment the scientists want you to do is measuring the temperature. Do you remember your rocket exploding when you went too fast? This cannot be explained by the pressure or drag experienced. Maybe it is because the rocket overheats.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Put a thermometer on the outside of the rocket. It should create a bit of drag. Reach a speed where you will see red airflow around your rocket. You should be able to read a high temperature. (Side note: the visibility of the red airflow might be dependend on your graphics settings)

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Launch a rocket with a thermometer.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Your scientists have some data to crunch on.
