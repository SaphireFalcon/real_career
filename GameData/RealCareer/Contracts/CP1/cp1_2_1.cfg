  description = Your boss Kelon Tusk is very happy with your results. However, he thinks your rocket doesn't look like a real rocket. He wants you to put some fins on it.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Your engineers think that these fins will be useless. They don't do any thing except adding extra weight. The extra weight will reduce the delta-v of the rocket and it will not reach the same altitude. But the boss told us to do this, so lets learn from (his) mistakes.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = You need to add some fins to the rocket.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! Though, your rocket didn't get as far. Shouldn't form follow function?
