  description = We managed to design and launch our first satellite. However, to get full coverage in orbit around Kerbin, we need more satellites. Your scientists started calculating and told you that you'll need at least 3 and up to 8 satellites around Kerbin, depending the range of the antenna and the altitude the satellites are orbiting. Also, they need to maintain their relative positions over time.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Find out how many and at what altitude your satellites need to orbit. Note: This is your first contract that requires multiple rockets to be launched, and it won't be easy! It will require you to combine different aspects of the game. First, you can (need to) find (on the internet) a tool that will help you determine the number of satellites and altitude. Second, to maintain the relative positions between the satellites, they need to have the same orbital period. A mod such as MechJeb is highly usefull for this. Lastly, good luck! You'll need it...

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Create a communication satellite network covering Kerbin.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, now you can send more rockets into orbit! Lets see how long this network will last. I forgive you if you cheated, this one was exceptionally hard...
