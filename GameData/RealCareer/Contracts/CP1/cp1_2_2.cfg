  description = You sat down with your engineers; The rocket used so far was fireworks taped together. This ofcourse will not reach space. So you ordered them to build something better. They came up with a better propulsion system (based on TNT) and created an improved rocket.

  notes = Make it go high as possible.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, you have managed to break our altitude record! Did you also see that the apoapsis reached 40km, but the rocket only a bit more that 22km? Maybe our researchers should look into that.
