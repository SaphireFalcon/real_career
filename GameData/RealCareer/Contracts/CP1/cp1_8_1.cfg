  title = CP1.8.1 - Communication Satellite
  group = CP1
  sortKey = CP1_8_1
  agent = SpaceK_CP1
  
  description = Now we managed to shoot a few rockets into space. But they also get soon out of range of our launch site, so we loose control. Together with your scientists and engineers you come up with a solution. You need to make a communication network!
  
  // Optional
  notes = Your rockets loose control when they get out of range. Design a satellite that can relay your signal. Note: This contract is again a step up in complexity. First, you'll need to bring batteries, solar panel(s), and an antenna to make a satellite. Secondly, one can find (on the internet) many different tools to help design your rocket/satellite. Look at least for a tool to determine how much battery capacity is needed to have enough energy to maintain communication on also the shadow side of Kerbin. Lastly, mods can be usefull, up to now, no mod was really needed. For this satellite, it could be handy (but not required) to use a mod like TweakScale to make the solar panel smaller, to save weight and make it look better.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = Create, launch and test your first communication satellite.

  completedMessage = Congratulations, this is your first satellite. Go on like this and the space agency will become usefull!
