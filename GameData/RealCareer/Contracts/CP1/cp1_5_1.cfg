  description = Your scientist have been calculating a lot, but they can't seem to figure out a few things. They want you to do a few experiments. One rocket has about 1500 delta-v, which is enough to get to space, but they estimate that to orbit Kerbin another 2000 delta-v are required. Therefore, they want you to stick a rocket on top another rocket.
  
  // Optional
  notes = Put a SK-350S v2 on top of a SK-350L rocket. This should give you at least 2000 delta-v. Note: From here on, the contracts will require you to build more complex rockets. This will require you to experiment a bit. In this case you'll notice that the bottom rocket does not have the same delta-v as without the rocket on top. This is because the weight that needs to be lifted by the bottom rocket is increased with the weight of the top rocket. Also, don't forget to read the messages after completing a contract. They sometimes give you relevant information.

  // The contract synopsis appears in bold.
  synopsis = See how high 2000 delta-v gets you.

  completedMessage = Congratulations! But we forgot the gyro!
